    <h2>What do I want in a Job?</h2>
    <p>
      Recently, I have seen various posts floating around the web where people
      share their views on what a workplace needs in order to look attractive to
      them and to keep them interested and engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my take on those lists, based on my experience in remote and
      on-location jobs throughout my career, both full time and part time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the following points are nice-to-haves while others are less
      negotiable and that mainly depends on the size of the company, location,
      culture and enumeration.
    </p>

    <h3>Environment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The office environment (if any) is pleasant, with separate desks, room
        acoustics and ventilation being thought of and no yelling across the
        room.
      </li>
      <li>
        Everyone — including the C-level — uses, knows the etiquette of and is
        active on a group chat platform such as Slack.
      </li>
      <li>
        I will work with people in a single time zone or a limited number of
        adjacent time zones (i.e. no insistance on me being available at 10 am
        Central European Time and also end-of-day at US-West Time for instance).
      </li>
      <li>
        A sufficient coworking space stipend for a “fixed desk” and amenities.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Berlin office with my team in it or a sufficient travel budget to meet
        my team or induvidiual coworkers and stake holders in person regularly
        or as required.
      </li>
      <li>
        The daily commute can include my gym without an unreasonable detour.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a safe place to keep my bike, preferably next to my desk.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have lockable drawers to keep things in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Company swag, if any, is delivered using a method that includes customs
        handling or in person (i.e. no hours-long journeys to the customs office
        to pick up single keychains or t-shirts).
      </li>
      <li>
        Company swag is well designed and made to last.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overtime and time off</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Food and snacks are not used as compensation for overtime.
      </li>
      <li>
        Monitoring, overtime and on-call hours are compensated for or result in
        <abbr title="paid time off">PTO</abbr>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Explicit number of annual paid vacation days is provided — preferably 30
        work days off each year.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sufficient sick leave allowance, preferably acucmilated.
      </li>

        A sufficient upgrade or amenity budget for railway travel and flights.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sufficient car rental budget where applicable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Daily subsistance allowance during business travel may be based on a
        standard reference like the one provided by the ICSC (International
        Civil Service Commision).
      </li>
      <li>
        Sufficient accomidation budget that follows a reference value.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest/recovery days are provided before and after long distance travel as
        required.
      </li>
      <li>
        My physical and mental health and safety is ensured during travel.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are policies in place that allow me to veto travel destinations
        and transit locations depending on their hostility to queer people,
        women and other minorities.
      </li>
    </ul>

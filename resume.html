        <p class="role">Software and database consultant</p>
        <p class="period">2014 - 2016</p>
        <p class="description">
          During my time with the United Nations, I worked on two separate
          projects. One for UNRWA; the UN programme for Palestine refugees and
          for The UN Monitoring Mechanism for Syria (UNMM). Both projects
          required on-site work such as needs analysis and liaison between
          different departments and agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first project was an offline-first tablet app built in Cordova,
          SQLite and AngularJS, which synced with a backend and reporting system
          built using ASP.Net MVC and Microsoft SQL Server, with data being fed
          into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet via PowerQuery for further work.
        <p>
          The latter was an extensive Ruby on Rails based data collection and
          reporting system for humanitarian shipments crossing the Syrian border
          and related work, with graphs using NVD3 and UI based on ActiveAdmin.
          The project required extensive coordination with the UNDPO and UNSBV
          in terms of infrastructure and security due to the limited scope and
          independence of the UNMM.

        <p class="period">November 2012 - August 2013</p>
        <p class="description">
          At Verðandi, my role started out as an ordinary web development role,
          but became closer to a tech lead and system administration job. There,
          I developed a social media promotion and raffle management system in
          PHP which I rewrote in Ruby on Rails. This system was later used to
          determine social media activity based on market segments such as age
          ranges. The system was used by raffles run for various brands and
          businesses such as Microsoft, Shell and Landsbanki.

          During the summer of 2018, I revamped the website of UNA Iceland —
          un.is. It includes a substantial amount of textual information and
          educational material that was moved from a proprietary CMS to
          WordPress. Due to the use of the site in public education,
          accessibility was highly prioritised.
